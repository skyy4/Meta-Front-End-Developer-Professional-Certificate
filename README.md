# Meta-Front-End-Developer-Professional-Certificate
The experience from taking certificates from Coursera was good. The Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate helped me tie together a lot of concepts I had been learning about and worked with in the past. It has given me the confidence to start my own projects and apply for full-stack positions.
